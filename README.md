## Game Off Game Jam:

This game was made in November of 2022 for the game jam "Game Off". 

The theme of the game jam was "clich√©", and we applied it to the storytelling aspect, taking advantage of as many overused literary ideas as possible, starting with the name of the game itself (it follows the trendy name format "A __ of __ and __", popularized by G.R.R Martin).
